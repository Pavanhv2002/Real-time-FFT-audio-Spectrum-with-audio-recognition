# Real-Time FFT Audio Spectrum with Audio Recognition

This project provides a real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) audio spectrum analyzer combined with an audio recognition system. It captures audio input in real-time, visualizes the frequency spectrum, and recognizes specific audio patterns using machine learning models. 

## Features

- **Real-Time Audio Capture**: Utilizes `pyaudio` or `sounddevice` to capture audio in real-time.
- **FFT Visualization**: Performs FFT on the audio signal and visualizes the frequency spectrum using `matplotlib`.
- **Audio Recognition**: Extracts audio features with `librosa` and classifies them using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (can be installed using `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-fft-audio-recognition.git
    cd real-time-fft-audio-recognition
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download or train a pre-trained audio recognition model and save it as `audio_recognition_model.pkl` in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Real-Time FFT Audio Spectrum Analyzer**:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

    This script will open an audio stream, capture real-time audio, perform FFT to compute the frequency spectrum, and visualize it.

2. **Audio Recognition**:

    The script will periodically extract audio features and classify them using the pre-trained model, displaying the recognized audio pattern.
